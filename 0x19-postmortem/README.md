Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: Imagine a world where time stood still, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on May 10, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: Picture this: about thirty percent of our consumers were stranded in the digital wilderness, trying to access our main online application but finding themselves lost in a maze of error messages or stuck in a virtual waiting room with outdated magazines.

Root Cause:
Ah, the elusive culprit! A mischievous gremlin sneaked into our load balancer configuration, playing favorites with the servers like a misbehaving child in a candy store.

Timeline:
9:50 AM: The digital alarm bells rang loud and clear as our monitoring systems detected a disturbance in the digital force—increased server response times!
9:55 AM: Our intrepid engineers donned their virtual detective hats, initially suspecting a database bottleneck. Elementary, my dear Watson!
10:15 AM: With a Sherlockian eye for detail, we uncovered the tangled web of traffic distribution irregularities, leading us straight to the load balancers' lair.
10:45 AM: Lo and behold! The miscreant revealed itself—the load balancer settings were as wonky as a three-legged table at a fancy dinner party.
11:00 AM: The call went out to our trusty DevOps team, armed with digital swords and shields, to tackle the beast head-on.
11:30 AM: With a flick of the digital wand, the load balancer configurations were corrected, restoring balance to the digital universe.
12:30 PM: Victory! The digital realm rejoiced as services were fully restored, and the digital watchdogs stood guard to prevent future incursions.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Thanks to the mischievous antics of our load balancer gremlin, incoming requests were as scattered as confetti at a virtual party, leaving some servers overwhelmed and others feeling neglected. Our valiant DevOps team sprang into action, tweaking the load balancer settings to ensure fair distribution of digital traffic. Monitoring systems were also upgraded to sniff out any future gremlins lurking in the shadows.



Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Load Balancer Configuration Review: Let's dust off the load balancer configurations and give them a thorough inspection, like a digital spring cleaning.
Automated Monitoring Enhancement: Our digital watchdogs are getting an upgrade, equipped with sharper senses to detect anomalies in load balancing and traffic distribution.
Documentation Update: Time to update the digital rulebook with proper load balancer configuration methods, ensuring future misconfigurations are as rare as a unicorn sighting.
Training and Awareness: Gather the digital troops for a crash course in load balancer best practices and troubleshooting techniques, because knowledge is power in the digital realm.

Our quest? To ensure our users never again find themselves stranded in the digital wilderness, lost in a maze of error messages. With these corrective actions and preventative measures in place, we'll keep the digital gremlins at bay and ensure our users enjoy smooth sailing in the digital seas.
